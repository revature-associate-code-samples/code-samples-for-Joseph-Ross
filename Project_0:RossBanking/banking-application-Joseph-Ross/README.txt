* User cases
This is a banking app where your user communicates with your app through the console
A user can create an account
A user can log in and log out(end interaction with the app and have transaction persisted)
A user can create one or more account(s) of savings or checking
A user can withdraw and deposit money
There is validation to make sure that usernames are unique, users aren't withdrawing more money than they have in the particular account, and that the application will not stop running if a user enters an incompatible data type with what your application expects
